Embed WordPress posts or products anywhere – like a Twitter Card. No iframe. No oEmbed. Just pure JS, full control, and beautiful design.

== Description ==

Init Embed Posts lets you embed WordPress content externally – with beautiful cards, real-time REST API data, and zero friction.

Instead of using iframes or clunky oEmbed, this plugin gives you clean `<div>` + `<script>` snippets, which load the post or product dynamically using WordPress REST API. Designed for speed, style, and full control – using pure JavaScript and smart caching.

This plugin is part of the [Init Plugin Suite](https://en.inithtml.com/init-plugin-suite-minimalist-powerful-and-free-wordpress-plugins/) — a collection of minimalist, fast, and developer-focused tools for WordPress.
